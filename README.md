# Auto Compile

## For

its helps me check my students code.

## Usage

* create file for each code
* prepare test cases

```
# for now test case is hard coding.

test = {
    'test' + x: "First-input\nSecond-input\n",
    'test' + x: "First-input\nSecond-input\n",
    'test' + x: "First-input\nSecond-input\n",
}

# x is number of each test case
```

* run script

```
python compile.py
```

* gets outputs or errors


## TODO

* auto create each file.java
* Exception handle
* Some bugs when create template file
* formal test case creation
* other issues (too much to list)
